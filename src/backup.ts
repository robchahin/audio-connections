 *    a final flourish, so deriveDayState only distinguishes won from lost
 *    via the mistake count, never via this list.
 *  - mistakes < MAX_MISTAKES means won; mistakes === MAX_MISTAKES means lost.
 *    When guessHistory is present we count wrongs from it; when absent
 *    (editor record) we set 0 for won and MAX_MISTAKES for lost.
 *  - trackOrder must be set-equal to the freshly-loaded track ids when the
 *    user opens this day, or the session loader treats our save as stale
 *    and reseeds via load-fresh — which immediately overwrites our record
 *    with an empty in-progress state. The check exists to catch puzzles
 *    that have been edited since a real save (a track added/removed); we
 *    have to manufacture a value that passes it. LoadedTrack.id is the
 *    positional index `i` in the flattened theme×track list (see
 *    usePuzzleSession.ts at the `id: i` assignment), NOT the iTunes id
 *    from RawTrack, so we use [0..trackCount-1]. */
